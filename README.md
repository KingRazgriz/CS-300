# CS-300


What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Cs-300 showed different examples that detaield a range of dsata models, such as binary trees, hash tables, & linked lists. This put emphasizes on the design, functionlity, & appropiate use cases in different software applications. From this, i was able to glem insight into how these structuresz optimized the performance of the application & solved specific computational problems.    
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I attempted to focus on understanding each data structures strengths & weaknesses, then applying them where it was more advantageous in comparison to the disadvantages. By using this approach, I was able to choose the most suitable structure based on the requirements of the module's application.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

I attempted to resolve challenges by use of youtube, and my online workbbook for documentation for different methods & examples to lead me. Sometimes, I tried to make short code snippets to test my  logic in as simpler fomr, then expand upon it. It was not always successful, but it helped me recognize errors early.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

The Big-O analysis pushed me to think critically about performance and how to approach algorithmic design. It also revealed that I don't naturally think in terms of recursion, which I recognized as a potential weakness in some of my designs.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I can work on developing my skills with continued practice. Once I started working with file streams, I've made s impler mental approach to upcoming issues, that can be statd as a bit of a prototype. Future considerations will allow me to reuse components & develop them into reuseable libraries for future projects I encounter.
